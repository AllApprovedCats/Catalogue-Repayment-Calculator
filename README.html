# Catalogue-Repayment-Calculator
Takes the credit amount, APR Rate and loan term length and outputs useful figures for the user.

Can be modified to work with other industries such as car payments, electronics financing etc.

Right now we have a simple project but I would like to turn this into an advanced calculator that can be used across multiple industries with more advanced inputs.

Project can be previewed at:
